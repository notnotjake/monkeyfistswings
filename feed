			<title>Thoughts on Apple Maps</title>
	         <link>http://www.notnotjake.com/</link>
	         <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings fellow travelers. Today I want to write about Apple Maps.&lt;br&gt;I rely heavily on navigation apps. Besides the normal uses, I&rsquo;ve also been doing DoorDash part time for the past two years. This is a job I simply couldn&rsquo;t do if I didn&rsquo;t have great navigation apps. That has been the singular Google Maps for&hellip; ever. Google Maps is reliable and it&rsquo;s functional - it&rsquo;s good.&lt;&#47;p&gt;
			 
			 &lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s been so good that it begs the question why Apple removed Google Maps in iOS 6?&lt;/p&gt;
			 
			 &lt;p&gt;I don&rsquo;t want to dwell on the history, but this is important. Apple didn&rsquo;t remove Google Maps from iPhone, Google told Apple to hand over user location data or else&hellip; and, well, we&rsquo;re living in the &lsquo;else&rsquo; timeline. It&rsquo;s been a bumpy road. Apple Maps has sucked until just recently. After removing Google Maps, Apple hobbled together various other sources with mediocre-at-best results. But now they&rsquo;ve gone and done it proper. The effort behind this new map is monumental.&lt;br&gt;I&rsquo;ve been using the new Map for the past six months, and I can tell you up front, I absolutely love it. Let me tell you why&lt;&#47;p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mileage May Vary&lt;&#47;h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;ve been using the Map since early February and you, reader, may recall receiving the updated Maps much earlier. In fact, Apple started this roll out way back in the summer of 2018. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps&quot;&gt;Justin Obeirne&lt;&#47;a&gt; has covered the rollout of Apple Maps pretty exhaustively if you&rsquo;re interested. Higher populated areas received the update with priority and on a project that literally spans the entire United States, the map in your area may be of a differing quality to what I&rsquo;m experiencing in my area.&lt;&#47;p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The New Map&lt;&#47;h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the visual style of this new map. It&rsquo;s much more appealing to look at when compared to Google&rsquo;s map which is largely grayscale. This is in large part due to what the new Apple Maps includes: roads, yes, but fields, forests, rivers, parking lots, buildings, sidewalks. There is a lot of detail on the map and technically Google Maps has most of the same data, but Google decides not to show users this data most of the time. Apple Maps does show all of this data and it&rsquo;s delightful. More than just looking great though, it&rsquo;s actually very useful. All of this information serves to allow you to verify the map knows where you are and inspires trust in you. When I see that the map has the shed I&rsquo;m driving by, it makes me feel like it must also have the major roads. It seems to stand to reason that if they&rsquo;ve mapped sidewalks and golf courses, they would have also mapped the important stuff like addresses and roads. By the way, that assumption seems to be Bourne out in my testing. This makes it practical&lt;&#47;p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Navigating With Apple Maps&lt;&#47;h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Striking&lt;&#47;h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What strikes you first when opening the Maps app, are the lush colors and detail. &lt;br&gt;Apple didn&rsquo;t just map roads and highways. It mapped buildings and foliage, it mapped soccer fields and sidewalks, golf courses and stop-lights. All these details are cute and colorful, they&rsquo;re even a tad whimsical.&lt;&#47;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The map changes elegantly as you zoom in and out. In comparison to Google, Apple Maps communicates space much more effortlessly. Google has never felt human to me, yes it gets me from here to there, but where is here and where is there? I&rsquo;m able now to look at the map and sense more intuitively where things are. I can see how roads connect.&lt;&#47;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of this is due to the way the app handles zoom levels and what information to display. Too much and you&rsquo;ll be overloaded but not enough and you lose context, you lose reference and you might miss what you were actually looking for. Apple Maps gets this, very human, problem more right than any other map I&rsquo;ve used.&lt;&#47;p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;A Sense of Place&lt;&#47;h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The maps detail isn&rsquo;t just nice, it&rsquo;s useful. For one, it inspires confidence. When I see the map has gone to the lengths of mapping nearly every building down to small sheds, it makes me think that it probably also mapped the roads. If you&rsquo;re looking for a destination by address you used to just see a pin on a street. It feels cold and disconnected, that&rsquo;s just a pin not my destination. But in Apple Maps, there&rsquo;s a 3d model of the house you&rsquo;re going to and it feels connected. The map feels less like a cold, cryptic chart and more like something tangibly related to the real world it&rsquo;s helping you navigate.&lt;&#47;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This map looks great! The colors and shading are nice in the daytime and the night mode is both easy on the eye and cool in its own right. Day and night versions of the map are purposeful. The night mode isn&rsquo;t just a darkened map, colors have been considered, and decisions have been made. I don&rsquo;t agree with all of them. At night, you don&rsquo;t see as many details. As far as I can tell they&rsquo;re mostly all still there but the amount of total contrast in the map is limited and thus only the most important elements of the map remain legible easily. Though I do miss the vibrancy of the day-time map at night, I do appreciate that I am more easily able to read the map at night. It&rsquo;s a choice, and I respect Apple&rsquo;s ability to make choices (unlike Google&rsquo;s thousand A/B tests).&lt;&#47;p&gt;</description>
