				<p>Where are we and where are we going? We’re faced with this question every day and in every moment. This is the eternal question anything living must ask itself, it’s the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22J3VaeABQAT-0aSPq-OKOpQlHyR4k5h">“map of meaning”</a>; at its most basic it might look like, “I’m hungry (a current state) and I want food (a motivated direction)”. This question in our lives mirrors that which we can ask of the society at large. We’re faced with challenges: a pandemic, political division, climate change and we’re faced with opportunities: the internet, space exploration, new materials. Metamodernism seeks to help us find our place in the present as well as point us towards a meaningful future. In this essay, we will try to understand the Metamodernism movement, and its relationship with truth and value, first by placing it in historical context and then by examining metamodernist productions and current events. </p>
				
				<h3>What Is?</h3>
				
				<p>Change is constant and our perception of reality is limited, yet we strive to make sense of the world and condense it into something simple and manageable. Humans have always faced the same core issues, issues such as love, hatred, and meaning. These everyday concerns are fundamental and even archetypal, and they are constant even as their manifestations evolve against the shifts in our environment. Since the dawn of civilization, the changes to the environment have been largely the result of our own actions. As an example, our need to form connections with others is constant, but our invention and adoption of technology has changed how we experience connection. Because of our ability to change our world, there is a cyclical nature between our actions, our response found in culture, and new ideas or consciousness which informs change in the future. </p>
				
				<p>We’ve seen two of these cycles take shape since the 19th century; modernism and postmodernism are two established periods and lead to our present moment. Today, many believe we are in the metamodern world. These three periods are distinct and so to make sense of their similarities and differences, we will analyze how each of them solve one of the most constant issues mankind has contended with, how to make sense out of the world and how to find meaning. In other words how do each of these movements answer the questions, what is, and what’s it all about?</p>
				
				<h2>Modernism</h2>
				
				<p>The 19th and early 20th century brought tremendous change both in the everyday and in the cultural domains. Modernity is a broad term describing modern life, that is life during the rapid changes of the late 19th and 20th centuries. During this time, technological advancements, social changes, and global turmoil changed the ways in which people understood the world and their own lives. Modernism then is the result or cultural reaction to <em>modernity</em>. People observed large discontinuity in their world, changes that were unprecedented and scared some. Modernism then was an attempt to reckon with this change and to understand it. To the pre-modern, Victorian mindset, these novelties didn’t fit in anywhere and quickly made the Victorian framework seem old and incomplete.</p>
				
				<p>Modernity featured bountiful scientific discoveries, growing urban populations, the industrial revolution, increased immigration and new technologies like the automobile. These advances translated into changes in the everyday lives of people. The ability to communicate across long distances is one example. World War I was another important element of this time as was America’s response to the war and its victory. Modernity was shaped by man’s ability to innovate, solve challenges and by incredible scale seen both in the good and the bad. </p>
				
				<p>On the cultural landscape, there were many other changes in response. Artists and intellectuals challenged norms, as well as their audience, and developed modernism as a diverse collection of works and approaches. At the core of modernism is a shifting of weight towards <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/">Naturalism</a>. While religion was still much more common at this time than it is today, its totalizing grasp on society was beginning to wane. The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche’s famous quote, <a href="https://bigthink.com/scotty-hendricks/what-nietzsche-really-meant-by-god-is-dead">“God is dead”</a> first appeared in 1882. This expression draws its roots from as far back as 1637 when René Descartes wrote <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-epistemology/">“I think, therefore I am”</a> establishing the center of reality as our consciousness, rather than the supernatural and God. The Enlightenment which grew from Descartes, focused on what can be observed and what can be rationally deduced. Nietzsche reasoned that the existence of God was incompatible with these modern Enlightenment ideals. This sentiment is the root of Naturalism, which is the belief that reality contains nothing supernatural and that Enlightenment ideals and the scientific method “should be used to investigate all areas of reality, including the human spirit” <a href="#archives" id="krikorian">(Krikorian, 1944)</a>. Modernists went about creating meaning and understanding reality without God by using <em>rational</em> methods. Modernists believed that mankind could understand the world in all of its depths by exploring it as scientists had explored the physical world.</p>
				
				<p>Whereas those of the Victorian era were sufficed by the meaning given to them through tradition and hierarchy, the modernists wanted to create it from scratch. In architecture, this can be seen clearly. The work of the Ancient Greeks continued to influence architecture hundreds of years later and the modernists rejected this sort of tradition. Instead architects such as Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright started from first-principles, asking the most basic questions to rationally construct something new and something better. Artists challenged the forms of the past, giving rise to new forms like Édouard Manet’s Impressionism, Gaudi’s Art Nouveau, and Picasso’s Cubism. </p>
