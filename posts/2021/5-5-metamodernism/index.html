				<p>Where are we and where are we going? This is the eternal question anything living must ask itself, it’s the “map of meaning”. We’re faced with this question every day and in every moment. This question in our lives mirrors that which we can ask of the society at large. We’re faced with challenges: a pandemic, political division, climate change and we’re faced with opportunities: the internet, space exploration, new materials. </p>
				
				<p>The present is constantly changing, and it’s different for every one of us. Our perception is influenced by so many things, it’s a whole science in itself. The vastness of our world accentuates our individual limitations. All of this conspires against our efforts to condense our world into something simple and manageable, yet we incessantly strive to do just that. Our present time resists generalization in additional, unique ways due to both our diversity and division. In America, we seem to lack a strong central meta-narrative to bind us all together. It is not uncommon to encounter a surprising resistance to something one took for granted. Beyond the disparate nature of our present, the current moment is one filled with the acknowledgement of our shortcomings, but fueled by an intuitive drive towards something meaningful. In this essay, we will try to understand our present moment first by placing it in historical context and then by examining current events and the culture.</p>
				
				<p>The same core issues have faced humans eternally, issues such as starvation, love, hatred, and meaning. The nature of our everyday concerns and of these fundamental and archetypal issues of life are constant, even as their surface manifestations evolve against the shifts in our environment. Since the discovery of agriculture and the birth of civilization, the shifting of the environment has largely been the result of our own actions. Our need to form connections with others is constant, but our invention and adoption of technology has impacted the manifestation of that core issue. The accumulation of enough change in our environment and culture create divisions in our history we can identify as periods or movements. There is a cycle between our actions, our response found in culture, and new ideas, or consciousness, informing further change in the future.</p>
				
				<p>Today, we each face these core, human issues in our daily lives, however on a larger scale, we are facing new issues and contending with a sufficiently different environment to recognize our present period as separate from the past. A global pandemic is most notable, but increased power of tech companies, political radicalization, and a “meaning-crisis” are all challenges we face today. As a result of these challenges there are new responses in our culture. To understand this let’s start in the late 19th century at the dawn of Modernism.</p>
				
				<p>Throughout these three periods, we will look at how we have tried to tackle the largest questions. What is it all about? What is true and what is right are informed by and inform this question. It is a cycle between a bottom-up approach and a top-down approach. At times one pillar has been seen as primary.</p>
				
				<h2>Modernism</h2>
				
				<p>The 19th and early 20th century brought tremendous change as scientific discoveries were bountiful and the world was changed by growing urban centers, the industrial revolution and immigration to America brought new ideas. There were changes in the everyday lives of people such as being better able to communicate across long distances, new jobs on the production line, and the impact of the First World War. </p>
				
				<p>On a larger scale, there were other cultural changes. While religion was still much more common than it is today, its totalizing grasp on society was beginning to wane. The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche’s famous quote, <a href="https://bigthink.com/scotty-hendricks/what-nietzsche-really-meant-by-god-is-dead">“God is dead”</a> first appeared in 1882. This expression draws its roots from as far back as 1637 when René Descartes wrote <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-epistemology/">“I think, therefore I am”</a> establishing the center of reality as our consciousness, rather than the supernatural and God. The Enlightenment which grew from Descartes, focused on what can be observed and what can be rationally deduced. Nietzsche reasoned that the existence of God was incompatible with the modern Enlightenment ideals.</p>
				
				<p>This sentiment is the root of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/">Naturalism</a>, which is the belief that reality contains nothing supernatural and that Enlightenment ideals and the scientific method “should be used to investigate all areas of reality, including the human spirit” <a href="#archives" id="krikorian">(Krikorian, 1944)</a>. Modernists went about creating meaning and understanding reality without God by using <em>rational</em> methods. </p>
				
				<p>Whereas those of the Victorian era were sufficed by the meaning given to them through tradition and hierarchy, the modernists wanted to create it from scratch. In architecture, this can be seen clearly. The work of the Ancient Greeks continued to influence architecture hundreds of years later and the modernists rejected this sort of tradition. Instead architects such as Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright started from first-principles, asking the most basic questions to rationally construct something new and something better. Artists challenged the forms of the past, giving rise to new forms like Édouard Manet’s Impressionism, Gaudi’s Art Nouveau, and Picasso’s Cubism. </p>
				
				<p>The modernists observed how in the pre-modern world, people </p>
