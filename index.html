					<p>Greetings fellow travelers. 
					When Apple Maps first launched in 2012, I couldn’t drive, but I didn’t need to, to know that Apple’s Map was a joke. Its reputation preceded it and that reputation has been slow to shake off. </p>
					<p>I rely heavily on navigation apps. A lot of people use navigation apps, of course, but for the past two years I’ve been doing food delivery as a side-gig sort of thing, and it’s a job I simply couldn’t do without great navigation apps. That has been Google Maps for… well, always. Google maps is reliable, dependable and function. In short, it’s good.</p>
					<p>It’s actually so good and has been so good for so long - even back in 2012 - that it begs the question; why did Apple remove Google Maps from iOS 6 ? 
					I don’t want to dwell on history, but this bit is important. Apple <em>didn’t</em> remove Google Maps from iPhone. <em>“Yes. They did”.</em> Okay, yes, but they didn’t come down from on high and proclaim Google Maps was being removed. What actually happened is that <em>Google</em> told <em>Apple</em> to hand over user location data or else… and, well, we’re living in the ‘else’ timeline. 
					It’s been a bumpy road. Apple Maps really was far inferior. After removing Google Maps, Apple hobbled together various other sources with mediocre-at-best results (and cross-continental-confusion at worst). </p>
					<p>But now they’ve gone and done it proper. They’ve ditched the third party data and they built a new map from the ground up. I’ll cut to the chase: the new map is amazing. They haven’t just caught up to Google, they’ve surpassed them.
					I love Apple Maps and let me tell you why.</p>
					<h2>Map Details</h2>
					<p>I trust the new map. Trust is really important for navigation because if you’re actually using it to get somewhere you yourself don’t know if it’s wrong until you get there. You have to trust it and 6 months ago when I would open the old Apple Maps I just didn’t. How does Apple get me to almost immediately trust the new map? Well, as someone who follows this stuff closely I knew about the effort they’d been putting into the map and I’d read Justin Obeirne’s stories comparing the maps. But what really does it is to simply open the Maps app and look around. You’ll immediately be greeted by a very pleasant representation of the world. If you zoom in just a little, you’ll see your house, the houses around you. Your neighbors shed, a pond, a forest.. oh yeah and roads too. The new Apple Maps is just packed full of detail. It makes switching back to Google Maps feel empty and dull. On an emotional and pleasantness level, Apple Maps’ details and styling are very nice, but all that detail also reinforces the idea that it’s accurate. If it has the neighbors shed I feel like it will also have the 2 acre shopping center. If it has my driveway, I feel like it will also have the actual roads. By impressing you so immediately with an insanely high level of detail, Apple Maps inspires trust in the user. </p>
					<p>As I said before, Apple Maps’ reputation has been very solidly negative, and so this is a big hurdle to get people over to Apple Maps. And in my opinion Apple Maps can’t just be as good as Google Maps, it has to be better. With regards to map detail it’s clearly ahead of everyone else in the industry. </p>
					<h2>Navigating with Apple Maps FAKE TEXT</h2>
					<h3>Striking</h3>
					<p>What strikes you first when opening the Maps app, are the lush colors and detail. 
					Apple didn’t just map roads and highways. It mapped buildings and foliage, it mapped soccer fields and sidewalks, golf courses and stop-lights. All these details are cute and colorful, they’re even a tad whimsical.
					The map changes elegantly as you zoom in and out. In comparison to Google, Apple Maps communicates space much more effortlessly. Google has never felt human to me, yes it gets me from here to there, but where is here and where is there? I’m able now to look at the map and sense more intuitively where things are. I can see how roads connect. 
					A lot of this is due to the way the app handles zoom levels and what information to display. Too much and you’ll be overloaded but not enough and you lose context, you lose reference and you might miss what you were actually looking for. Apple Maps gets this, very human, problem more right than any other map I’ve used. </p>
					<h3>A Sense of Place</h3>
					<p>The maps detail isn’t just nice, it’s useful. For one, it inspires confidence. When I see the map has gone to the lengths of mapping nearly every building down to small sheds, it makes me think that it probably also mapped the roads. If you’re looking for a destination by address you used to just see a pin on a street. It feels cold and disconnected, that’s just a pin not my destination. But in Apple Maps, there’s a 3d model of the house you’re going to and it feels connected. The map feels less like a cold, cryptic chart and more like something tangibly related to the real world it’s helping you navigate.</p>
